# My Blog

This blog is built with Hugo using the minimal theme 'PaperMod'.

## Hugo PaperMod
My reasons for choosing Hugo & PaperMod:
<ul>
<li> I chose Hugo because it's super fast ⚡️ &has great documentation 📝 
</li>
<li> I chose PaperMod because I loved the minimal design 🎨 and it also uses vanilla JS & CSS 🍦</li>
<li> I didnt want lots of frameworks/ packages/ plugins because it feels a bit overkill for a small personal blog that is intended to document my tech learning/ journey 👩🏼‍💻
<li> Chose to use Markdown instead of a Headless CMS to hopefully create a good habit of using Git/GitHub more frequently 😅
</ul>
